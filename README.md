# About Me 🌟
Hey! I'm Joy Davis, a senior at Texas State University, pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Business Administration. I am a data analyst, where I blend my technical skills with my passion for problem-solving. I am constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow, and I am eager to apply my knowledge in a professional setting.

Throughout my academic journey, I have developed proficiency in SQL, Python, Excel, and Tableau. These tools have allowed me to analyze complex datasets, uncover meaningful insights, and present findings in a clear and impactful manner.

I enjoy the challenge of diving deep into data to identify trends, solve problems, and support strategic decision-making. The ability to see beyond the numbers and understand the story they tell is what excites me the most about data analytics. Every dataset is a new puzzle to solve, and each analysis helps to reveal a piece of the larger picture. 🔍
